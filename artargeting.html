Players will be able to spend their Mech Credits at Mech Trading Posts throughout the city.</p>

                                <p>GeoFencing, the virtual act of targeting people in a specified area based on their geolocation has been around for years and is one of the newest advertising avenues. You may have experienced the ads that pop-up when you use different apps on your mobile device. Many people find these ads an inconvenience to their user experience, but GeoFencing still remains a highly effective method of advertising your business.</p>
                                <p>What we are doing is taking the software designed for GeoFencing to the next level of marketing advantage. Right now, a geo-fenced advertisement could show on a person's phone as they drive past your business. Is that useful to you as a company? To some extent it is, but the turnover rate of ad views to actual customers is still quite low (Nationally, the click-through rate is less than 2%).</p>
                                <p><a href="darksolstice.html">Dark Solstice</a> is our first game in development that will be designed on an AR (Augmented Reality) platform. What this means is that players will follow directions on their phones to locate specific points in their city to find targets where they can accumulate credits. In other words, we will be setting up virtual credit kiosks that read the geocoded information in the user's mobile device when they arrive at the physical location in order to award them a specified amount of game credits.</p>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <div class="col-md-6"><img src="img/gaming/phone-hand2.jpg" /></div>
                                    <div class="col-md-6"><p>We will also be setting up Virtual Trading Posts, located at physical locations in each city, where the players can redeem their credits for game-related items to be used in other layers of the game. Players will, on average, spend 2 to 3 minutes at these Trading Posts making purchases, and it is our intent to find sponsors who, for a monthly fee, will host a location in order to gain the extra foot-traffic. In marketing terms, if your business is the Mech Trading Post closest to a player it is more likely than not that they will be drawn to your front door!</p></div>
                                </div>
                                <p>To paint a meaningful picture...say you own a small bike shop and you choose to host a virtual Mech Trading Post. Players of the game will be directed to a location within 10 feet of your front door to spend their credits. They will be there, in front of your store for a few minutes, which is much more than you can say for other types of advertising. Perhaps they may think (especially with a little marketing wizardry): "Hey, I could sure get from credit kiosk to credit kiosk a lot faster if I had a bike!". Moreover, as a business you could do things that will help to entice them even more. Perhaps a small discount for Dark Solstice players? Or you could sponsor a bike ride to collect game credits throughout the neighborhood. These are just examples of the easy steps that can be taken to capitalize on our AR Targeting platform.</p>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <div class="col-md-5">
                                        <p>The normal click-through rate on a geo-fenced ad is 1.2%. That means that, on average, you will get one click for every 120 views of your ad. And there's no guarantee that a click results in a customer (in fact, research shows that most of these clicks are accidental). With AR Targeting through our revolutionary gaming platform, when a player is directed by the game to your front door, they <i>ARE</i> going to your front door. They may not walk in, but the odds are more in your favor than they are with regular advertising.</p>
                                        <p>Just imagine how this can positively effect your business. If you've ever walked around a shopping mall, you know how enticing it is to walk into a random store, just because it's there. If you have a retail or food-related business, this could be your company's ticket to increased location-based sales.</p>
