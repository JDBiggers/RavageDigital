                        <p>Packs of Love&trade; is one of our primary support initiatives aimed at giving children who have physical or psychological disabilty a little bit of happines in their daily life.</p>
                        <p>Many don't understand the challenges families of children with a disability face with events and expenses that most take for granted. For some, providing their children with even the most basic school supplies is an expense that is hard to bear.</p>
                        <p>While we can't provide every child in need with the necessary supplies and tools to be successful, we do want to help as many as we can.</p>
                        <p>At the completion of our first game, Dark Solstice, we plan to inititate our first annual Packs of Love campaign <a href="gofundme.html">(help us finish on time!)</a>. We hope to be able to provide at least 1000 children with backbacks full of school supplies and other goodies the first year. AND WE ONLY WANT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER FROM THERE EACH YEAR!</p>
                        <p>We intend to complete Dark Solstice in the third quarter of 2020 and be able to provide our first recipients with their supplies before the holidays.</p>

                        <p>We are a new startup, and because of that we are heavily invested in completing Dark Solstice so that we can meet the goals of our <a href="mission.html"> mission</a> and also continue to provide the best quality services and product.</p>
                        <p>We recently started a <a href="#" data-link="gofundme"> GoFundMe</a> account to raise the necessary funds to finish Dark Solstice on time and with the quality control we expect of ourselves. $5 will buy you an advanced download of the game (3 weeks before the official release in November) and there are other incentives for higher support investments. <a href="gofundme.html" class="light-box">(Let Me See What I Can Get)</a> <p>
                        <p>However, if you are simply interested in helping out directly with our Packs of Love&trade; campaign. Please feel free to contact us by email or through the nearby form.</p>
