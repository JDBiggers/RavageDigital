At that time, we will be releasing more images, videos and sample game play. Keep in mind, we are looking for <a href="gofundme.html">support</a> to continue work and complete on time--and <strong style="color:cornflowerblue"><a href="gofundme.html">supporters</a></strong> will gain access to Dark Solstice a <strong>full 3 weeks before its official release!</strong>

                                <p>Earth, 2030...Ten years since the cleansing. Millenia of war between nations and disputes over social beliefs had not prepared us for the the tactics and technology of the "horde", the collective name given to the invaders. An ancient race of unkown origin, the horde's final intent for humanity is still unclear, but their use of the planet's resources is beyond anything we could have ever imaged or done on our own.</p>
                                <p>We were completely caught by surprise when the horde attacked, their ships appearing on our long-range detectors only after they reached our atmoshpere. The first wave obliterated all of our military installations within an hour, leaving no opportunity for us to defend the planet. We were too caught up in our own unimportant disputes to see the oncoming onslaught and within a few days, nearly 90% of the population was lost. Remaining humanity was sent to "H-Sectors", cities allocated to to human life throughout the world. Cut off from each other, inhabitants of the "H-Sectors" struggle to survive.</p>
                                <p>But there is hope. Bands of strong-willed men and women formed a resistance against the "horde", collectively calling themselves "The Awakening". Members of the The Awakening call themselves "Mechs" due to the specialized weaponry and body armor they utilize. Mechs are diverse ad enigmatic warriors, but all have one goal in mind: taking back Earth and giving humanity a fighting chance.</p>

                            <p>The game takes place on this post-invasion Earth, a year after the bots first arrived. Much of society has fallen and the population greatly diminished. No one knew how devastating these bots would be. When the bots first arrived they sent kindly emissaries that looked friendly, even cute. However, that was only a trick they learned to help them overcome the primary species of the planet they intended to drain of life.</p>

                            <p>Dark Solstice is designed as a triple-layered game, offering a multitude of experiences which allow players to play at any time.</p>
                            <p>Dark Solstice will allow for a multi-platform experience, allowing players to be active on the console, PC, mobile, and we are even going to be offering VR experience like no other. This adaptability will set Dark Solstice apart from other games in the industry and envelop players in a truly breathtaking atmosphere. Multi-format playability will be the key to success for Dark Solstice.</p>
                            <p>This will allow players to play while on-the-move, waiting around, or entrenched in their gaming chairs</p>
                            <p>Ravage Studios will also be implementing a Virtual Reality Experience shorty after the release</p>

                            <p>As a Dark Solstice player you are tasked with defeating the horde and its numerous enslaved monsters in a number of different scenarios. Players choose a character which will be their avatar throughout the game. Each character has a backstory, some of which are related related to our company's mission of helping children with disabilities. Avatars either have a disability (or ability?) or they fighting on behalf of someone with a disbility. This game will show people that a disability doesn't prevent someone from becoming a warrior.</p>

                        <p>Throughout the game, players collect <strong style="color:cornflowerblue">"Mech Credits" (aka MC's)</strong> which can be used to purchase specialized gear and power-ups to aid their playing experience. For example, one of the characters, Enessa is a 23 year old woman whom lost her arm when the first wave of horde attacks began. Instead of giving up and living in the shadows like many others now do, she decided to fight back and joined The Awakening. She has fitted herself with a fashionable prosthetic that she upgrades with specialized weaponry and other items. Each character has special items and upgrades they can purchase at <strong style="color:cornflowerblue">Mech Credit Trading Posts</strong> using their earned MC's. (As the game evolves we hope to promote sponsorships with local businesses, allowing players to trade their MC's for real world items as well).</p>

                            <h2 class="heading">Earning Mech Credits the Mobile Way</h2>
                            <p>Mech Credits can be earned in a number of ways. The first and most profitable method is through the first layer of the game which is based on augmented reality geolocation technology (note: no Ravage Digital product will ever be used to sell data to other companies). Throughout the country (in real life) hundreds of thousands of locations will be selected for a virtual Mech Credit Kiosk (aka MCK). When a user arrives at one of these MCK's while playing the game, their virtual wallet will be credited with the amount allocated for that location.</p>
                            <p>Some of these locations will have other items, such as med-packs or repair tools which will be useful in the third layer of the game. Others will be "Surprise" locations that could have huge payoffs or no payoff at all. We will also have weekly "contest" locations where the first 20 players who reach the location will earn triple the Mech Credits. Location activation will be random each day and offer maximum playability. <strong style="color:cornflowerblue">Mech Credit Trading Posts</strong> will also be located throughout each city or town, allowing a user to purchase special weapons, protective gear, and other useful items. These locations will generally be sponsored by local businesses and will remain static (in the same place) day to day.</p>

                            <h2 class="heading">Augmented Reality on a New Level and Intense Puzzle Play!</h2>
                            <p>The intent of layer 1 of Dark Solstice is to help people find the initiative to get up and get moving for a cause, though it is not necessary to play the game. Layer 1 has two modes: Mech Player and Mech Fitness. Mech Player is for the individual who prefers to drive from location to location (We don't judge), While Mech Fitness is more activity-related. Want to make Epoch a part of your daily jogging or walking routine? Want to be able to show some impressive numbers on your Fit-Bit &reg to your significant other? Mech Fitness is for you. It will allow you to build a great route while collecting your credits. Plus credits earned during a verified Mech Fitness game play can earn up to double Mech Credits (geoloctaion technology will be used to verify the movement speed of the device).</p>
                            <p>Layer 2 is primarily designed as a middle ground where gamers can play just for fun or earn Mech Credits while waiting around. It consists of puzzle and strategy games where players earn mech credits by successfully completing levels. There aren't as many available points in Layer 2 as there is in Layer 1, but it gives people the opportunity to earn Mech Credits in places where Layer 1 is not an option. Sitting on the bus, laying in bed at night, or just relaxing at home; you can still earn credits.</p>

                            <p>And we know there are many out there who don't have the ability or time to get out on the town. Some of these men, women, and children are the ones our company is trying to look out for. So we came up with two solutions. The first gives players the ability to have a surrogate collect Mech Credits in their name. Players can sign up to be a surrogate when they first activate the game allowing them to sponsor someone who wants to play Layers 2 and 3 but don't have the ability to be active. The second alternative is in Layer 2 of the game.</p>

                            <p>As part or the company's <a href="mission.html">Platinum Promise</a>, we have integrated an exciting way to make this game help children on a more personal level. Not only is each player collecting Mech Credits, so is each character. Each player has a virtual Mech Credit wallet, and each game character does as well. In other words, if 13,000 players choose Enessa as their avatar, and each of these players earns 10,000 credits, Enessa has earned 130,000,000 credits! Why is this significant? When Enessa's (or any other character's) pot reaches a pre-determined amount, ravage Studios will provide direct support to a child with a disability related to the played character. In Enessa's case we will purchase a <u>premium</u> arm prosthethic for a child in need. If the character ulilized a mobility device, we will donate a premium wheel chair, etc. This is beyond our <a href="mission.html" class="href_gold">50% Rule</a>. As our motto goes: "Entertainment for a Cause!".</p>

                            <h2 class="heading">Meet the Horde and their Monsters Head On</h2>
                            <p>Layer 3 is the reason for all the hard work players do in Layers 1 and 2. While it is possible to go directly to Layer 3 and put one's skills to the test, the weapons and supplies purchased earning Mech Credits make the game far more exciting and the player will feel more like they earned their right to be a Mech.</p>
                            <p>Layer 3 is where these post-apopcalyptic players show what they are made of. Players go head to head against the horde, their monsters and their futuristic weaponry to prevent them from destroying what is left of humanity and eliminate the invaders. Each scenario is in a different location with a specific overall objective that players must complete in order to move on to the next. For example, in the scenario "Winter Harbor", not only is the player trying to eliminate the enemy, they also need to get to the end of the pier to destroy a Horde water-siphoning ship that is draining the Earth's water supply. Another level is an abandoned carnival that doubles as a Horde training facility.</p>
                            <p> It's a fight for our future, and you can play to be on top.</p>
                            <p>Intelligent graphic design and 3D modelling will immerse players in the world of Dark Solstice. Scenarios will constantly be updated and added on a regular basis to keep the game fresh and up-to-date. In the future, we hope to add MR (Mixed Reality), VR (virtual Reality), and Arcade functionality to ensure that players get the most out of their experience.</p>

                            <p>We will be developing an arcade version of the game that will utilize 5G and wi-fi to allow players to log into their Dark Solstice player account and use their existing avatars with all the goodies they've collected during their play experience and test their skills against other players.</p>
