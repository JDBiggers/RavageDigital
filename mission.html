                            <h2 class="title text-primary mb-3">Corporate Responsibility</h2>
                            <p>Ravage Digital is founded on the concept of delivering cutting-edge entertainment and business solutions with an underlying sense of corporate altruism as our defining factor. The concept of returning the support of our customers to local communities is central to our blueprint.</p>
                            <p>We believe that all actions taken by Ravage Digital should have a core goal of benefiting society and tackling issues experienced by children with disabilities and their families. Giving back is the cornerstone of our business model and drives our sense of ethical responsibility.</p>
                            <p class="text_ravagegreen">That is why a minimum of 50% of the company's profits will be returned to the community through aid to children's non-profits or through direct support to children with disability and families in need.</p>

                            <h2 class="title text-primary mb-3">Always Strive to Give More</h2>
                            <p>Because we are so dedicated to helping those in need, we want to take our corporate responsibility a step further by making a more specific and direct impact on the life of children in need.</p>
                            <p>We will make every effort to incentivize our products by including an extra level of giving that will have a more direct impact. Dark Solstice, our first gaming experience will be the flagship of this extra-giving effort.</p>
                            <p>For example, in the game there are a number of characters with some form af disabilty which they have overcome. When players earn credits using these characters, the players earn credits for use in the game, but each of the characters also has a virtual wallet where the combined credits are being saved.</p>
                            <p>Once a characters wallet reaches a certain goal, Ravage Digital will purchase and donate a specialized item to a child in need. For example, one of the characters, Enessa, has a prosthetic arm. When her wallet reaches a specified goal, we will work with the family of a child missing a limb and provide them with a premium custom-made prosthetic.</p>
                            <p>It is our goal to implement some kind of extra incentive such as this into as many of our products as we can, because we know it is only with the help of our customers that we can do what we do.</p>

                <h3 class="text_ravagegreen">A Word from the Founder:</h3>
                <p>The overall concept of the Ravage Digital Business model is a result of interest in competing in a number of different technology and entertainment-related industries while maintaining a desire to give back by helping children with disability. What I envision is a framework that will allow us to remain viable in a number of markets while maintaining the values of our mission and continue to grow as a leader in corporate altruism.</p>
                <p>My purpose in establishing the company was to build a legacy for my children and allow me to meet my more "pay it forward" goals. As I grow older and wiser, much like many parents, I understand that I should spend more time time with my children. As my children are now adults, the best way to let them know that I am there for them and care about their futures is to build something that grows from their interest and will provide a decent income. I meshed together the individual strangths and interests of my children, whom collectively run the company, to form the ravage Studios bluerpint of success.</p>
                <p>You may be wondering why the company name is "ravage". The first 5 letters (RAVAGE) are an acronym of the first initials of my children and grandchildren: Robert, Anthony, Victoria, Aiden, and the "G" in the logo is actually two "J"s for Jasmine and Jolyn (So the next grandkid needs a name beginning with an "E" to fulfill the legacy).</p>
                <p>Ravage Digital is home not only to to my children, but to the many employees we also consider our family. Moreover, we want all of our clients, particularly the children we hope to help, to feel like Ravage Digital cares. As we move forward with projects and continue to profit, we hope to open, Nspyr (inspire), a non-profit dedicated to helping children with disability and their families.</p>
                <p>We have a long road ahead of us, and with the <a href="gofundme.html">help of the public</a> we know we can do some really big things to create wonderful gaming experiences, spectacular business products, new technologies, and some really big smiles on some children's faces.</p>
                <p>Thank You. JD Biggers. <span id="joseph"></span></p>
