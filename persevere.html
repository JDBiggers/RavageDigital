                                With television and movies overly exagerating the lifestyles and personalities of individuals who have been convicted of a crime, it is easy for most people to write these men and women off as "un-saveable". While there are a significant number of these individuals who have indeed earned that label, there are exponentially more who simply made some bad choices at the wrong time. Who among us hasn't.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This might be surprising to many, but there is humanity within the correctional system, and most have come to a crossroads in their life and truly want to be better people, not only for themselves, but also for their families and society at-large. Growth and Learning are important part of this process, and the sad truth is that many of these men and women will not be successful successful unless THEY WANT IT, because there are a lot of systems at play which work against them, both inside and out. By no means are we saying that none of these individuals shouldn't be in prison. But we do say that when their time comes, they should be afforded a good opportunity at success through their hard work and determination to be better people. For many, opportunity is all they ask for.
                            </p>

                                    Persevere, a program dedicated to helping some of these men and women find their place in the world, is an example of a company intent on making sure that people who want to become more socially-responsible learn new skills in order to more productive and responsible when they are released. After all, no one wants an ex-felon running around with no skills, no future, and nothing else to do...it's just better for society if released inmates are prepared AND accepted into society.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Persevere culminates their view on rehabilitation through a training program focused on teaching the skills necessary to thrive in a modern, tech-advanced world. Through motivation and training, Persevere helps a select number of incarcerated individuals learn web development techniques and the life skills that will give them higher odds at a successful future.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For many, helping incarcerated persons doesn't seem like a prudent use of resources or even an important task, but the truth is, the vast majority of those incarcerated WILL at some point be released. Isn't it better to have them willing and able to be productive members of society?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whether you know someone who has been to prison, someone currently in prison, or have been to prison yourself, you know the importance of giving support to those who will make the most of it. We want to thank Persevere for their contribution to these men and women and the effect it will have on their lives. We also want to thank the Persevere teachers and counselors who take the time to support and mold the futures of these men and women.

                                        Poor decision-making caused many doors to be closed for me in life. Persevere has given me the opportunity to open new doors and become successful.
